<h1>Litecoin-Menu-Bar</h1>

Live Litecoin (LTC) to EUR crypto currency exchange rates on the macOS menubar.

This menu bar app is in its alpha stage of development. This means that the application is under development and is improved on a regular basis â€“ through commits that add features and content, optimizations and bug fixes. You can clone the whole project and try it on your Mac to get an idea! :smile:
